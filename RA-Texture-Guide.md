**Using Texture Packs with __RetroArch__**
So you want your Ocarina of Time to look super fancy? Used to Project64 letting you use texture packs? Want to use them on a regular, stable emulator? Read on.

You will need to use the **Mupen64Plus** core for RetroArch. ParaLLEl N64 does **not** support texture packs.

You can obtain compatible `.HTC` texture packs from <http://www.emutalk.net/forums/134-Completed-Projects>

Once you have the texture pack you'd like (and be sure to follow any instructions found within the thread, obviously disregard anything relating to PJ64), follow these steps:

- Navigate to your RetroArch installation folder
-- By default, this is `%AppData%\RetroArch` on Windows
- Navigate to `.\system\Mupen64plus\cache`
- Place your texture pack within the `cache` folder
- If you do not have a cache folder, create one.

And then load the ROM with the Mupen64Plus core selected. Finally, enable the option `Quick Menu -> Options ->  Use High-Res textures and Use High-Res Full Alpha Channel`. Reload the content You should now have your texture pack active.
